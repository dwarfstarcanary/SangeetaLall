    <h1> Aspirations </h1>
    <img src="aspirations.png" height="75%" width="75%">
    <p> Growing up, I have always loved the art of storytelling. I aspire to tell my own stories through films and video games.
        At Hunter, I am a film majoor with an emerging media minor. My goals are to build a portfolio and to strengthen my writing skills.
        I would love to be part of the entertainment industry, more specifically as a game design concept artist or a screenwriter.
        My goal for senior year is to intern at Riot Games. </p>
