    <h3> What constitutes a creative web project today? </h3>
    <p> A lot of creative web projects today consist of engaging visuals with a game-like or cinematic feel. By enriching the online experience we retain information a lot easier.</p>

    <h3> How do each of you wish to employ the web or the internet as a creative platform? </h3>
    <p> I love art and technology and I am currently working on building my own portfolio website that best represents my style. For me it's all about aesthetically pleasing visuals that offer something deeper.</p>

    <h3> What are your goals in this course? </h3>
    <p> My biggest goal in this course is to strengthen my knowledge of HTML and CSS. I would love to learn Javascript in order to implement into my own website.</p>
